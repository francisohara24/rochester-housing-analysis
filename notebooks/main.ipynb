    "1. Produce a spreadsheet of all students with 2 columns:\n",
    "    a. RA for each student.\n",
    "    b. Whether the student has done an intentional interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Produce 2nd spreadsheet comprising the ff:\n",
    "    a. RA name\n",
    "    b. Total no. of intentional interactions had.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "1. Develop general algorithm to be used to identify RAs and intentional interaction status for all students.\n",
    "    a. Iterate through list of all students\n",
    "    b. For each student, determine if variations of first and lastname are present in Roster with high confidence.\n",
    "    c. If name is present,\n",
    "        - update intentional interaction status to YES\n",
    "        - update RA column with name of RA from Roster.\n",
    "    d. Make use of **Room Number** criteria to simplify entire process.\n",
    "2.  a. For remaining students not captured by step 1, develop less precise algorithm that checks for presence of at least last name in Roster.\n",
    "    b. Isolate all such students and filter manually."
